				Get your app development skills up to speed by learning iOS 9 and the Swift programming language.  Totem's unique al-a-carte syllabus allows you to build an iOS app development training course around the features and frameworks of iOS 9 that interest you. Let us build the foundational skills at the beginning of the course, and quickly dovetail into your iOS learning needs for the rest of the week.  We start off the session with a deep dive into the Swift language, then move into UI / UX development concepts that power all iPhone and iPad apps.  We then hand the reigns over to you, allowing you to drive the rest of the curriculum from our list of iOS 9 modules.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
